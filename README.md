# Sample WPF Application That Restores Its State

Demonstrates an application that saves and restores the position, size and maximisation state of the main window.

Multiple monitors are supported. If a monitor is not more present, then the window will be positioned on available monitors.

The corresponding code is in **MainWindow.xaml.cs**. Some properties are defined in **Settings.settings**.
